# Convolutional-Autoencoder-Tensorflow-2
Convolutional autoencoder models built using tensorflow 2 and the code also has the flexibility to test using different hyperparameters and models and losses
the CAE models are written only for the mnist,fashion mnist dataset however the same code can be used for different datasets by just changing model and the dataset loading part

# Files description 
  * [Data_pipline.py](Data_pipline.py) is the custom data loader built using tf.data API more about this data loader can be found [Here](https://github.com/shashidhar100/Custom-Image-Dataset-loader-in-Tensorflow-2).
  * [utils.py](utils.py) this file consists code for setting global seed.
  * [models.py](models.py) this file consists of the models to be used.
  * [Convolutional Autoencoder.ipynb](https://github.com/shashidhar100/Convolutional-Autoencoder-Tensorflow-2/blob/main/Convolutional%20Autoencoder.ipynb) this is a jupyter notebook where the training code is written.
